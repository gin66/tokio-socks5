            // TODO: This exact logic for reading/writing amounts may need an
            //       update
            //
            // Right now the `buffer` is actually pretty big, 64k, and it could
            // be the case that one end of the connection can far outpace
            // another. For example we may be able to always read 64k from the
            // read half but only be able to write 5k to the client. This is a
            // pretty bad situation because we've got data in a buffer that's
            // intended to be ephemeral!
            //
            // Ideally here we'd actually adapt the rate of reads to match the
            // rate of writes. That is, we'd prefer to have some form of
            // adaptive algorithm which keeps track of how many bytes are
            // written and match the read rate to the write rate. It's possible
            // for connections to have an even smaller (and optional) buffer on
            // the side representing the "too much data they read" if that
            // happens, and then the next call to `read` could compensate by not
            // reading so much again.
            //
            // In any case, though, this is easily implementable in terms of
            // adding fields to `Transfer` and is complicated enough to
            // otherwise detract from the example in question here. As a result,
            // we simply read into the global buffer and then assert that we
            // write out exactly the same amount.
            //
            // This means that we may trip the assert below, but it should be
            // relatively easily fixable with the strategy above!
